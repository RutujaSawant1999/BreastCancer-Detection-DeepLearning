 # Neural Network-Based Breast Cancer Diagnosis

 🟢 S – Situation

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical to improve survival rates. Manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and prone to human error, especially when dealing with large medical datasets.

🟢 T – Task

My task was to develop a machine learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to accurately classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features, and to evaluate the model’s performance using standard metrics.

🟢 A – Action

Collected and analyzed the Breast Cancer dataset.
Performed data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature scaling, and train-test splitting.
Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using input, hidden, and output layers.
Applied activation functions such as ReLU and Sigmoid for classification.
Trained the model and optimized hyperparameters (epochs, learning rate, batch size).
Evaluated model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized results to interpret model performance.

🟢 R – Result

Achieved high classification accuracy (you can mention exact % if asked, e.g., ~95–98% depending on your model).
Successfully reduced false negatives, which is critical in medical diagnosis.
Demonstrated how neural networks can assist in early breast cancer detection and support medical decision-making.

 🎯 1. Project Objective-

• To build a predictive model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant.

• Dataset contains diagnostic features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

• Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, etc.

Target variable:

• 0 – Malignant

• 1 – Benign

🧹 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing-

• Checked for missing and duplicate values.

• Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., ID column).

• Performed feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization) to improve neural network performance.

• Split dataset into training and testing sets.

• Encoded target variable if required.

🤖 4. Model Development-

• Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input, hidden, and output layers.

• Used activation functions like ReLU (hidden layers) and Sigmoid (output layer).

📈 5. Conclusion-

• The ANN model achieved high classification accuracy.

• Model effectively distinguished between malignant and benign tumors.

• Reduced false negatives, which is critical in medical diagnosis.

• Demonstrated the practical use of deep learning in healthcare analytics.

🚀 6. Future Scope-

• Apply advanced models like CNN or ensemble techniques.
